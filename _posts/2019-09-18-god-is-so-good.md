## God Is So Good

```
[Verse 1]
A         E                A
God is so good,  God is so good;
A         D             A    E  A
God is so good, He’s so good to me.

[Verse 2]
A           E                A
He loves me so,  He loves me so;
A           D           A    E  A
He loves me so, He’s so good to me.

[Verse 3]
A        E               A
Now I am free,  Now I am free;
A        D             A    E  A
Now I am free, He’s so good to me.

[Verse 4]
A         E                  A
God is so good,  He loves me so;
A        D             A    E  A
Now I am free, He’s so good to me.
