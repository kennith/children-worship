```
C                      G
The wise man built his house upon the rock
The foolish man built his house upon the sand
So, build your life upon the Lord Jesus Christ
                       C
The wise man built his house upon the rock
The foolish man built his house upon the sand
So, build your life upon the Lord Jesus Christ
                       G
The wise man built his house upon the rock
The foolish man built his house upon the sand
So, build your life upon the Lord Jesus Christ
                           C
And the rain came tumbling down
And the blessings will come down

[Chorus 1]
C
Oh, the rain came down
Oh, the blessings come down
        G
And the floods came up
As your prayers go up

The rain came down
        C
And the floods came up

The rain came down
        G
And the floods came up
                               C
And the wise man's house stood firm.
And the foolish man's house went 'splant'
So build your house on the Lord Jesus Christ.
