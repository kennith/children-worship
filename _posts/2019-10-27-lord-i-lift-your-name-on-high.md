## Lord, I Lift Your Name On High

```
G        C                 D   C G
  Lord I lift your name on high

         C                 D      C G
  Lord I love to sing your praises

         C                  D   C G
  I'm so glad you are in my life

         C                D      C G
  I'm so glad you came to save us

                C              D    C           G
  You came from heaven to earth, to show the way

               C            D     C          G
  From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay

           C                 D
  From the cross to the grave, 

           Em7             Am7
  from the grave to the sky

         D                 G
  Lord I lift your name on high
