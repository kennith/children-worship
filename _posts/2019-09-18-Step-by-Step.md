## Step by Step

```
 G               D
O God you are my God

    C           D      G
And I will ever praise you (x2)

---

       Em                D
I will seek you in the morning

           C                   Am
And I will learn to walk in your ways

     G                  D
And step by step you'll lead me

           C                D    G
And I will follow you all of my days

---

            Em                   D
And I will follow you all of my days

            Am                   C
And I will follow you all of my days

    G                     D
And step by step you'll lead me

            C               D    G
And I will learn to walk in your ways
