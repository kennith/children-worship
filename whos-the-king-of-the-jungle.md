Who's the King of the jungle?
G                      D
Who's the King of the sea?
G                      Em
Who is the King of the universe?       
    C         D       G
And who's the King of me?
          C
I'll tell you J-E-S-U-S. (Yes!)
G                     D
He's the King of the sea.
G                    Em
He's the King of the universe, 
    C        D       G
And He's the King of me!
